I am typing this line to branch
A student just shared with me that he has financial struggles.
His father has refused to pay his fees so he has to raise them himself.
He already deferred two years and should be in third year now.
But he is in first year.
What does he think I can do?
It is heartbreaking but there is nothing I can do.
I've told him to go to Dean of Students.
I honestly don't know if he can help him, but I hope so. You never know.
